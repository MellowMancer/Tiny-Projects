# Minute-Makes

Welcome to this collection of all the small and tiny projects that I have made which are not big enough to make a repository of their own. Listed down are small descriptions of each project.

## Pong Using OPENCV

This is a project which aims to introduce a new way to play Pong. With your face!
Control the bar with face movements and look stupid as you bounce in your chair to keep your score up.

Keybind for pausing the game: `p`
Keybind for closing a running game: `q`
